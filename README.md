# CS-300

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

    The Advising department of a University needed a way to upload a course list fro
    a csv file and print the data in an alphanumerically sorted list. Also the ability
    to print the details of a single course from the list was requested.
    
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

    The pseudocode for the possible data structures used for sorting was written, then the 
    menu to access the requested functions and the pseudocode for alphanumerically sorting 
    was written. After that, a runtime analysis was created to determine the best data structure. 
    Finally, the code itself was written in the same order the pseudocode was developed. Data 
    structures are important, because without knowledge of what structures fit different uses, 
    the wrong structure could be chosen for the given task, which could slow the runtime of the 
    program unnecessarily.
    
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

    Roadblocks in this project were overcame by working on the code in chunks and commenting out 
    different parts of bugged code until the isses were found and resolved.
    
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

    This project has helped me become a lot more used to and less confused about using pointers 
    in C++, and how the process of developing a program involves more than just writing the code itself.
    
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

    This project has helped me with breaking down different parts of the program into individual functions 
    and commenting correctly, making the main code much easier to read.
